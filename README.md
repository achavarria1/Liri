# LIRI-Bot

To use the Liri application, use the command line and type in:

node liri.js

When there is no action specified after the initial command, liri.js will default to display the possible action of liri.js

### These actions are:

- spotify-this-song 'song name'
- concert-this 'artist name'
- movie-this 'movie name'
- do-what-it-says

Notice that the very last action does not require any specified name. This last action defaults to read from random.txt file.

### Here is an example of how to use Liri:

node liri.js spotify-this-song Small World

There is an example mp4 video of how to use liri in this repo. Look above!
